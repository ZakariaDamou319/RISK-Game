# RISK 

The program that we'll be coding is an implementation of the real-time strategy game, RISK. Our current version is a GUI-based version of the game, the newest addition is the save and load feature aswell as a new custom map addition, a Canada map. 
The authors of the code are Jamil Dergham, Matthew Shirazi, Zakaria Damou, and Ahmad Aboudeh. 
The deliverables that we'll be submitting today are: 

•	A JAR file containing our source code for all classes
•	A UML Diagram
•	A Sequence Diagram 
•	Documentation 

The Jar file will contain all the source code for our classes.  
The UML diagram will show each class’ attributes and methods and how the classes connect to each other.  
The sequence diagram will demonstrate how our code implements a single turn of RISK. 
The documentation will help explain our design choices and how to play the game. 

What changes were made since in this milestone? 

No new classes were made, several methods were added. The player can now select at the start of the game between two maps, the classic World Map and the newly added Canada Map. In the middle of the game the user can now save their game, close it, and load it back at a different time.
